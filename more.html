                        <p class="about-city">Tashkent, Uzbek Toshkent, capital of Uzbekistan and the largest city in Central Asia. Tashkent lies
                            in the northeastern part of the country. It is situated at an elevation of 1,475 to 1,575 feet (450 to 480 metres) 
                            in the Chirchiq River valley west of the Chatkal Mountains and is intersected by a series of canals from the
                            Chirchiq River. The city probably dates from the 2nd or the 1st century BCE and was variously known as Dzhadzh, 
                            Chachkent, Shashkent, and Binkent;
                            the name Tashkent, which means “Stone Village” in Uzbek, was first mentioned in the 11th century.Today Tashkent is the main economic and cultural centre of Central Asia. Cotton is the chief crop of the region in which it is situated. Wheat, rice, jute, vegetables, and melons are also grown, and silkworms are bred. The city lies in the most industrially developed part of Uzbekistan, and much of its industry is in some way connected with cotton—the manufacture of agricultural and textile machinery and of cotton textiles. It also has various food-processing industries. The city’s numerous institutions of higher education and research establishments include the university, founded in 1920, and various institutes of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences, set up in 1943. Also notable is the Navoi Public Library. The city’s numerous theatres, Uzbek and Russian, include the Navoi Theatre of Opera and Ballet. There are also a Palace of the Arts and several museums, parks, and stadiums. The city has been extensively rebuilt since an earthquake in 1966 left 300,000 people homeless. A few 15th- and 16th-century religious buildings and mausoleums survive, including the Barakkhan Madrasah (religious school).</p>

                    <p class="about-city">Samarkand, Uzbek Samarqand, city in east-central Uzbekistan that is one of the oldest cities of Central Asia.
                        The old city’s plan has streets converging toward the centre from six gates in the 5-mile- (8-km-) long, 11th-century walls. The walls and gates were destroyed after the capture of the town by the Russians, but the plan of the medieval period is still preserved. The old city contains some of the finest monuments of Central Asian architecture from the 14th to the 20th century, including several buildings dating from the time when Samarkand was Timur’s capital city. Among the latter structures are the mosque of Bībī-Khānom (1399–1404), a building that was commissioned by Timur’s favourite Chinese wife, and Timur’s tomb itself, the Gūr-e Amīr mausoleum, built about 1405. To the second half of the 15th century belongs the Ak Saray tomb with a superb fresco of the interior. Rīgestān Square, an impressive public square in the old city, is fronted by several madrasas (Islamic schools): that of Timur’s grandson, the astronomer Ulūgh Beg (1417–20), and those of Shirdar (1619–1635/36) and Tilakari (mid-17th century), which together border the square on three sides. Samarkand has several other mausoleums, madrasas, and mosques dating from the 15th to the 17th century, though they are not as impressive as the structures from Timur’s day. The principal features of Samarkand’s ancient buildings are their splendid portals, their vast coloured domes, and their remarkable exterior decorations
                        in majolica, mosaic, marble, and gold. The historic city was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2001.

                    The historic centre of Bukhara, designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993, still retains much of its former aspect, with its mosques, madrasas (Muslim theological schools), flat-roofed houses of sun-dried bricks, and remains of covered bazaars. Among important buildings are the Ismāʿīl Sāmānī Mausoleum (9th–10th century); the Kalyan minaret (1127) and mosque (early 14th century); the Ulūgh Beg (1417), Kukeldash (16th century), Abd al-ʿAziz Khān (1652), 
                    and Mir-e ʿArab (1536) madrasas; and the Ark, the city fortress, which is the oldest structure in Bukhara.

                It is impossible to make a bad photo on the territory of Ichan-Kala fortress. Everything around is literally saturated with the atmosphere of the past and walking along these streets, you feel the spirit of the time. There are certain places where you can get special shots. One of such places is Juma (Friday) Mosque, built in the X century. It does not have 
                portals and domes, and the hall ceiling stands on 213 columns of different sizes, shapes and even manufacture time.

        <p class="about-city">Kokand, Uzbek Qŭqon, city, eastern Uzbekistan. It lies in the western Fergana Valley, at road and rail junctions from Tashkent to the valley.
            The ancient town of Khavakend occupied the site from at least the 10th century and was situated on the caravan route from India and China. In the 13th century it was destroyed by the Mongols. The present city developed from a fort that was constructed in 1732, and in 1740 it became the capital of the khanate of Kokand. The khanate, centred on the Fergana Valley, enjoyed its greatest power in the first half of the 19th century, when it extended northward into present-day Kazakhstan. Under the khans Kokand was an important centre of trade and handicrafts as well as the religious centre of the valley, with more than 300 mosques.
            Kokand now has textile, food, engineering, and chemical plants and is the main transport junction in the Fergana Valley. It also has a teacher-training institute and a theatre.

            In 2007, the country widely celebrated the 2000th anniversary of Margilan. This is another city in the list of famous historical cities of Uzbekistan with a millennia history.
            Located in the south of the Fergana Valley, Margilan lies in a picturesque place that formerly was right at the crossroads of trade caravans from China to the West and vice versa. The origin of Margilan is closely related to the opening of the Silk Road. 
            The main streets led from the gate to the center of Margilan, where the palace of the governor - Urda and local market were situated. Residential areas were organically combined with religious buildings, very few of which have survived. The most famous ancient monuments in Margilan 
            are the Complex Pir Siddiq, the architectural composition Pir Siddiq, the Mausoleum of Khoja Magiz and many others.
